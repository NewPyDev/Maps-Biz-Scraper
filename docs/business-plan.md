## ⚖️ Legal Considerations

### Data Scraping Legality
```
✅ LEGAL (Generally):
- Publicly available data (Google Maps is public)
- No login/authentication required
- For commercial use (with proper terms)
- Comply with robots.txt (be respectful)

⚠️ GRAY AREA:
- Selling scraped data (check local laws)
- GDPR compliance (EU data)
- CAN-SPAM Act (if using for email)

❌ ILLEGAL:
- Scraping private/password-protected data
- Violating terms of service aggressively
- Not honoring opt-out requests
```

### Recommendations:
1. **Add disclaimer**: "Data sourced from publicly available information"
2. **Offer opt-out**: Let businesses request removal
3. **Don't spam**: Sell data, don't use it for unsolicited emails yourself
4. **Terms of Service**: Require customers to comply with anti-spam laws
5. **GDPR**: If selling EU data, add "for B2B use only" clause
